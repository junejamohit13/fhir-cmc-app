# Current Project Status

## Implementation Summary

We've successfully implemented AWS Cognito authentication integration with Application Load Balancer (ALB) for the FHIR-CMC application. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished:

### 1. Cognito ALB Integration
- Modified Cognito user pool client in `terraform/modules/cognito/main.tf` to:
  - Set `generate_secret` to true for ALB authentication
  - Configure OAuth flows to use "code" flow only
  - Add callback URL for ALB OAuth2 responses

### 2. ALB Authentication
- Added data sources for AWS region and caller identity in `terraform/modules/network/main.tf`
- Updated HTTPS listener to authenticate with Cognito
- Added special rules for health checks and OAuth2 callbacks to bypass authentication
- Fixed listener rule priority conflicts (changed from priority 1,2 to 5,10)

### 3. Module Dependencies
- Reordered modules in environment terraform files for proper dependency resolution
- Added explicit depends_on declarations to avoid circular dependencies
- Updated Cognito output names from `cognito_domain_fqdn` to `user_pool_domain_fqdn`

### 4. Docker Image Builds
- Updated the `terraform/build-images-for-ecr.sh` script to:
  - Set up Docker BuildX for multi-architecture builds
  - Build images for both linux/amd64 and linux/arm64 platforms
  - Push directly to ECR with proper platform manifests
  - Fix container platform compatibility issues

### 5. Health Check Configuration
- Added health check endpoints to backend services
- Created dedicated listener rules for health checks
- Modified target group health check paths

## Fixed Issues
- Circular dependency issues in Terraform modules
- Cognito output name mismatches across environments
- ECS service deployment failures due to failing health checks
- ALB listener rules priority conflicts
- Container image platform compatibility issues (CannotPullContainerError)

## Next Steps
The infrastructure has been validated and tested with multiple container architectures. When we want to redeploy, we'll:

1. Run the `terraform/build-images-for-ecr.sh` script to build and push multi-architecture container images
2. Apply the Terraform configuration to deploy the infrastructure in AWS

## Notes for Future Sessions
- We've updated image build scripts to ensure proper platform support for ECS
- Listener rule priorities have been adjusted to avoid conflicts (5, 10 instead of 1, 2)
- Health check endpoints are correctly configured
- The ALB is properly integrated with Cognito authentication
- All infrastructure was destroyed after validation to save costs
